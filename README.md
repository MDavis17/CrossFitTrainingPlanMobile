#CrossFitTrainingPlanMobile

CrossFitTrainingPlanMobile is a swift iOS application to access a personal google sheet holding my personal workout plan. This application utilizes an api that has access to the google sheets api, and uses the data response to present the workout data for a selected date in a more digestable format.
